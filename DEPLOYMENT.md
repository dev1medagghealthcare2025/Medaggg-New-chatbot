# Netlify Deployment Guide for MedAgg 2.0 Chatbot

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git repository (optional but recommended)

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project

### 1.1 Move the Chatbot Image
**IMPORTANT**: Copy `Chatbot.jpeg` from the `public/` folder to `src/images/` folder:
```bash
# Create the images directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir src/images

# Copy the image file
copy public/Chatbot.jpeg src/images/Chatbot.jpeg
```

### 1.2 Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 1.3 Test Local Build
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a `dist` folder with your production-ready files.

## Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

### Option A: Drag & Drop Deployment
1. Run `npm run build` to create the `dist` folder
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login
3. Drag and drop the entire `dist` folder to the Netlify deploy area
4. Your site will be live instantly!

### Option B: Git-based Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Netlify will automatically detect the build settings from `netlify.toml`
4. Deploy settings will be:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Node version**: 18

## Step 3: Configuration Files Created

### `netlify.toml`
- Configures build settings
- Sets up redirects for SPA routing
- Optimizes caching headers

### `public/_redirects`
- Fallback routing for single-page application
- Ensures all routes serve `index.html`

### Updated `webpack.config.js`
- Added asset handling for images
- Content hashing for cache busting
- Code splitting optimization
- SPA routing support

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

After deployment, test:
1. âœ… Main page loads
2. âœ… Chatbot toggle button appears with image
3. âœ… Chatbot opens and functions properly
4. âœ… All icons are visible (send button, voice button, avatars)
5. âœ… Messages send and receive correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Image Not Loading
- Ensure `Chatbot.jpeg` is in `src/images/` folder
- Check that the import path is correct in `chatbot.jsx`

### Build Fails
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
- Clear cache: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`

### SPA Routing Issues
- Verify `_redirects` file is in the `public/` folder
- Check `netlify.toml` redirect configuration

## Performance Optimizations Included

1. **Content Hashing**: Files have unique hashes for cache busting
2. **Code Splitting**: Automatic chunk splitting for better loading
3. **Asset Optimization**: Images are processed and optimized
4. **Caching Headers**: Long-term caching for static assets
5. **Gzip Compression**: Automatic compression on Netlify

## Custom Domain (Optional)
After deployment, you can:
1. Add a custom domain in Netlify dashboard
2. Enable HTTPS (automatic with Netlify)
3. Set up form handling if needed

Your MedAgg 2.0 chatbot is now ready for production deployment! ðŸš€
